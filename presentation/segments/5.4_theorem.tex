\begin{frame}{Universal Approximation Theorem}
    
    Any continuous function  $f : [0, 1]^{n} \rightarrow [0, 1]$  can be approximated arbitrarily well by a neural network with at least 1 hidden layer with a finite number of weights.

    Even if neural networks can express very complex functions compactly, determining the precise parameters (weights and biases) required to solve a specific PDE can be difficult.
