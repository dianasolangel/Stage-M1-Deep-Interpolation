\begin{frame}{Implementation}

    We implemented a solver based on the SL scheme, and implemented the deep Lagrange interpolation operator with the $u_{pred}$ approximated by a  NN  that uses the  PINNs  strategy 
    for  different  initial  conditions depending on the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$.

        \item \textbf{Neural Network class:} Represents a neural network model.
        \item \textbf{Network class:} Represents a PINNs model implementing the previous NN class and the Adam optimizer algorithm.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Train function:} Optimization step for training a NN by combining  PDE  constraints, data  fitting and boundary conditions, implementing the MSE loss, and a backpropagation step. 
        \end{itemize}  
        \item \textbf{Semi-Lagrangian solver:} Implements the SL scheme using the deep interpolation.
