\begin{frame}{Final remarks}

    \textbf{Outlook:}\\
    There is still further research to be done implementing different initial conditions, other deep learning models and explore their full 
    potential in solving more complex equations.

    \textbf{Personal feedback:}\\
    This internship provided me with a valuable opportunity to delve into a field where my prior knowledge was limited to the surface level.
    
    The topic of PINNs really interested me and how we can apply deep learning to more scientific fields. I found really interesting projects done by others 
    in the medical field or chemistry. 

    It challenged my patience, organization skills. In overall, I feel I learned a lot and even if there were things that didn't work out at the end
    I feel proud of my work.
