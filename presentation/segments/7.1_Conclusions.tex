\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}

        \item By implementing the SL scheme with the deep learning interpolation operator and the
        $u_{pred}$ function found using the PINNs strategy a reduction in the error is found as compared to the Lagrange interpolation.
        
        \item The application of the deep operator with 1st-degree interpolation exhibits a more significant improvement when compared to the 3rd-degree interpolation.
    
        \item The  PINNs  strategy  exhibit  a  remarkable capacity to assimilate a diverse range of solutions for the advection equation, with different initial conditions and parameters
