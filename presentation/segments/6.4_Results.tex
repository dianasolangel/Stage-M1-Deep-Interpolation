\begin{frame}{Average gain}
    By  randomly  drawing  20  parameters  for  the  mean  and  the  variance  to  have different  initial  conditions,  
    we  calculate  for  each  the  solution with the  classic and deep SL method, we look at the gain $=$ SL error/deep SL error 
    and by doing the average and by making several draws of 20 parameters we obtain:
