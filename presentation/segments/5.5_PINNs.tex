    \begin{itemize}
        \item PINNs are a type of universal function approximators that can embed the knowledge of any physical laws that govern a given data-set in the learning process, and can be described by PDEs.
        \item They approximate PDE solutions by training a neural network to minimize a loss function; it includes terms reflecting the initial and boundary conditions along the space-time domainâ€™s boundary and PDE residual and data points.
        \item PINNs training can be thought of as a supervised and/or supervised learning approach.
    \end{itemize}
